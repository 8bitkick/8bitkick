### Hi there 👋

I like computing history and building the computing future. Projects include:

🤖 **Social bots:** - creator of the Twitter-famous [BBCMicroBot](https://github.com/8bitkick/BBCMicroBot), now on Mastodon

👁️ **Immersive web** - building mixed-reality stuff with threejs and WebXR like [VirtualBeeb](https://virtual.bbcmic.ro) and [VoxelAstra](https://github.com/8bitkick/8bitkick.github.io/tree/master/VoxelAstra)

🧠 **Embedded AI:** Making [TinyML](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoTensorFlowLiteTutorials) accessible to developers everywhere

📺 **Retrocomputing:** Hook up your 80s Acorn machine to a [virtual cassette deck](https://github.com/8bitkick/PlayUEF)!
