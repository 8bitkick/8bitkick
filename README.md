### Hi there 👋

I like computing history and building the computing future. Interests include:

🧠 **Embedded AI:** - I lead AI software enablement for [Synaptics](https://developer.synaptics.com)

🤖 **Social bots:** - creator of the Twitter-famous [BBCMicroBot](https://github.com/8bitkick/BBCMicroBot), now on Mastodon

👁️ **Immersive web** - building mixed-reality stuff with threejs and WebXR like [XR Beeb](https://xr.bbcmic.ro) (featured in Meta Quest3 browser!)

📺 **Retrocomputing:** Hook up your 80s Acorn machine to a [virtual cassette deck](https://github.com/8bitkick/PlayUEF)!
